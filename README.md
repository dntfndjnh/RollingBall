# RollingBall
I made a mini-game using Unity.

A ball rolls continuously until you touch the screen.
When you touch the screen, the ball jumps.
The longer you wait before touching, the stronger the jump.
If the jump power is too strong, the ball will collide with the ceiling.
Your score is calculated based on the total flight time and the number of clicks.
