# RollingBall
<h1>I made a mini-game using Unity.</h1>

<li>A ball rolls continuously until you touch the screen.</li>
<li>When you touch the screen, the ball jumps.</li>
<li>The longer you wait before touching, the stronger the jump.</li>
<li>If the jump power is too strong, the ball will collide with the ceiling.</li>
<li>Your score is calculated based on the total flight time and the number of clicks.</li>
